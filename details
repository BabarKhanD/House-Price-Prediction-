🏡 House Price Prediction

📌 Task Objective
Predict house prices using machine learning models (Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting) based on property features such as:
- Area (square footage)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location-related attributes
- Amenities (main road access, furnishing, etc.)

📂 Dataset Used
Source: [Housing.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset)  
The dataset includes the following features:
- `price` (target)
- `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`
- `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `airconditioning`, `hotwaterheating`
- `furnishingstatus`, `prefarea`, `parking`

🤖 Models Applied
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

📊 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

📈 Visualizations Included
- Line Plot (Actual vs Predicted)
- Scatter Plot (Actual vs Predicted)
- Bar Chart (First 20 predictions)
- Sorted Line Plot

🧪 Results Summary
| Model               | MAE       | RMSE      |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression   | *(your result)* | *(your result)* |
| Gradient Boosting   | *(your result)* | *(your result)* |

> Gradient Boosting showed better performance overall.
